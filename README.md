# Bees Game

A co√∂perative multiplayer network-based game, 
where players must control swarms of bees 
to collect as much pollen as possible.

Developed for Reboot 2021.

**Note:** this is currently in very early development, 
and still needs a lot of work to be functional.

## Getting Started

To compile the server, you will need to download
the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) programming language.
I recommend using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).

Once you have installed Rust, open a new terminal
wherever you cloned this repository.
Use the following commands to build and run the server on your machine.
This should install all required dependencies for you.

```
cargo build
cargo run --release
```

**TODO:** client programs (python?) 
and website frontend (just a static JS thing, hopefully, though maybe node?).
